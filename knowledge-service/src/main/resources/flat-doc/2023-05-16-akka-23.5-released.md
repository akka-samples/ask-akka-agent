## New features

For deeper insight into some of these new features, please visit the [Lightbend blog](https://www.lightbend.com/blog), which will be featuring a new feature weekly for the next month.

The noteworthy features are:

* [Akka Distributed Cluster](https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-distributed-cluster/current/index.html) is a set of features that will help you with stretching an Akka Cluster over geographically distributed locations, and provides asynchronous communication between different Akka Microservices without using a message broker.
It comes with new features such as:
  * Projections over gRPC -- asynchronous brokerless service-to-service communication.
  * Replicated Event Sourcing over gRPC -- active-active entities.
  * Dynamic event filters that can be defined on both the producer and on the consumer side, and they can be changed at runtime.
* [Improved rolling updates in Kubernetes](https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-management/current/rolling-updates.html#kubernetes-rolling-updates) by defining Pod deletion cost corresponding to Akka Cluster member age and Akka Cluster `app-version` from Kubernetes revision.
* [Dynamic scaling of number of Sharded Daemon Processes](https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-core/current/typed/cluster-sharded-daemon-process.html#dynamic-scaling-of-number-of-workers), e.g.
Projection instances.
* Storing a [query representation of Durable State](https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-persistence-r2dbc/current/durable-state-store.html) without using asynchronous Projection processing.
* Store event, snapshot and durable state [payloads as JSON](https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-persistence-r2dbc/current/postgres_json.html) in PostgreSQL with Akka Persistence R2DBC.
* [Database cleanup tool](https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-persistence-r2dbc/current/cleanup.html) in Akka Persistence R2DBC.
* [`mapAsyncPartitioned` Streams operator](https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-core/current/stream/operators/Source-or-Flow/mapAsyncPartitioned.html#mapasyncpartitioned)
* Using [Akka Cluster with mTLS and rotated certificates in Kubernetes](https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-core/current/remote-security.html#mtls-with-rotated-certificates-in-kubernetes).
* Scala 3 support in:
  * Akka HTTP
  * Akka gRPC
  * Akka Management
  * Akka Persistence R2DBC
  * Akka Persistence Cassandra
  * Akka Projections (some modules)
  * Alpakka Kafka
  * Alpakka (some modules)
  * Akka Diagnostics
* [Akka Diagnostics](https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-diagnostics/current/) with Thread Starvation Detector and Config Checker.
* [Automatic expiry of Distributed Data entries](https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-core/current/typed/distributed-data.html#expire) and [subscribe to entries with wildcard naming](https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-core/current/typed/distributed-data.html#subscribe).
This is useful for building cache like data structures with Distributed Data.

## Security Updates

## Compatibility

Akka 2.8.x is compatible with Akka 2.7.x and 2.6.x aside from removal of two deprecated modules:

* Classic Remoting transport has been deprecated since Akka 2.6.0 (2019-11-06) and is replaced by the Artery transport, which has been the default since 2.6.0 and declared ready for production in Akka 2.5.22 (2019-04-03).
* OSGi packaging and support in Akka has been dropped.

By compatible, we mean:

* Akka 2.8.x is binary backwards compatible with 2.7.x and 2.6.x, i.e.
a library built with Akka 2.6.x can still be used with an application using Akka 2.8.x.
* No configuration changes are needed for updating an application from Akka 2.6.x or 2.7.x to 2.8.x.
* Rolling update of Akka Cluster from Akka 2.6.x or 2.7.x to 2.8.x is fully supported.

Other modules included in Akka 23.05 are also compatible with their previous version.
